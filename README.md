Project Overview:

This project extends the initial analytical capabilities to focus specifically on Workforce Management, Attendance Patterns, and Employee Well-being. 
It tackles crucial modern HR questions regarding work preferences (WFH vs. WFO), potential patterns in remote work behavior, and the critical tracking of employee health events, such as sick leave related to COVID-19, to inform organizational precautions and policy.

The goal is to provide HR with predictive and descriptive insights to optimize resource allocation, workplace policies, and ensure a healthy working environment.

Key Objectives:

1. Work Modality Preference Analysis

    -> Objective: Understand the overall employee preference and distribution between Work From Home (WFH) and Work From Office (WFO).

    -> Metric: Track the percentage of the workforce utilizing each modality over time.


2. Remote Work Pattern Investigation

    -> Objective: Identify and investigate patterns of frequent WFH utilization, particularly on Mondays and Fridays.

    -> Insight: Analyze if this pattern suggests extended weekend behavior, requiring policy review or targeted communication.

3. Weekly/Monthly Attendance Monitoring

    -> Objective: Provide a clear, aggregate view of workforce presence.

    -> Metric: Calculate the percentage of people present (WFO + WFH) on a given week or month to monitor overall engagement and operational capacity.

4. Sick Leave and Health Risk Identification

    -> Objective: Understand the reasons behind sick leave to implement necessary organizational precautions.

    -> Critical Insight: Flag sick leaves reported due to contagious illnesses (e.g., COVID-19) to trigger immediate company action (e.g., sanitization, contact tracing, specific WFH mandates).
